For example, \"I love this product!\" would have a positive polarity, while \"I hate this product!\" would have a negative polarity. Many sentiment analysis methods assign polarity values on a scale, typically from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive), with 0 representing neutral sentiment.\n",

        "  Lexicon and Rule-based Sentiment Analysis: This method uses a predefined list of words (lexicon) each associated with a sentiment score (positive or negative). The text is analyzed word by word and a final sentiment score is computed based on the scores of individual words and some syntactic rules. For example, the word 'good' may have a positive score, but 'not good' would be considered negative due to the rule that handles negations. This method works well when the text closely aligns with the lexicon and rules defined. However, it can fail with complex language structures, sarcasm, or context-specific sentiment.\n",

It involves training a model on a large amount of labeled data (text with associated sentiment) and then using this model to predict the sentiment of new, unseen text. It can handle complex language structures and context-specific sentiment better than rule-based methods, as it can learn these from the training data. The downside is the requirement of large amounts of labeled data, and the complexity involved in training and tuning the model."

        "VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically created for social media content, but it works quite well on many types of text. It uses a combination of a sentiment lexicon, grammatical and syntactical rules to predict the sentiment of text. Here's a basic idea of how polarity scores are computed:\n",
        "\n",
        " Lexicon Score: VADER has a lexicon (a dictionary of words) where each word has been assigned a sentiment score (positive or negative) from -4 to 4 based on human-annotated data. For example, words like 'love' have positive scores, and 'hate' has a negative score. Neutral words like 'and' or 'the' have a score of 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "Contextual and Syntactical Adjustment: The basic sentiment score from lexicon is adjusted based on the context. For example, words like \"not\" before a word can flip the sentiment of that word. Intensity is considered as well (e.g., \"good\" vs. \"extremely good\"). It also considers punctuation such as exclamation marks, and emoticons or emojis, which are common in social media.\n",
        "\n",
        "Aggregation: VADER then aggregates these scores and produces the final scores: positive, negative, neutral, and compound. The 'compound' score is a normalised score of all of the lexicon ratings which have been standardised to range between -1 and 1."

        "\n",
        "Polarity: This is a floating-point number that lies in the range [-1,1], where 1 means positive sentiment and -1 means a negative sentiment. TextBlob calculates the polarity by taking the average sentiment of all words in the text that are found in its sentiment lexicon. Each word in the lexicon has been human-annotated with a sentiment polarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Subjectivity: This is also a floating-point number that lies in the range [0,1]. Subjectivity quantifies the amount of personal opinion and factual information contained in the text. The higher subjectivity means that the text contains personal opinion rather than factual information. TextBlob follows the same approach for calculating subjectivity: it takes the average subjectivity of the sentiment-laden words in the text."
